# Used Tech :tada:
<br>
Single User mode, Group User mode and Administrator modes are provided by our service.
For Single User mode and Group User mode, we support Android(minSdkVersion >= 22) application.
Application has been built using Kotlin mostly, with a little bit of Java. And for anministrator mode,
who is in charge of overall running application(Using C#). For more intergrated service, 
we used Firebase Authentication, Firebase Firestore(database) for our service. 
Any trouble shooting is extreamly welcomed.
